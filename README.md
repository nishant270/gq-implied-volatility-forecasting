# gq-implied-volatility-forecasting
Time-series forecasting model predicting Ethereum's 10-second-ahead implied volatility using high-frequency order-book and cross-asset market data. Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training (LightGBM), and walk-forward validation for Kaggle competition submission.

# GQ Implied Volatility Forecasting

Forecasting Ethereum's 10-second-ahead implied volatility using high-frequency order-book and cross-asset market data.  
Developed as part of the [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gq-implied-volatility-forecasting).

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project builds a **time-series forecasting pipeline** to predict ETH implied volatility (IV) at t+10 seconds.  
Key steps:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (missing timestamps, outliers).
- Feature engineering:
  - Order-book imbalance.
  - Rolling realized volatility.
  - Cross-asset returns.
- Model training using **LightGBM**.
- Rigorous walk-forward validation to avoid data leakage.
- Submission evaluation using **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**.
